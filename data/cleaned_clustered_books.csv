For Tracy, eating a frog is a metaphor for tackling your most challenging task - but also the one that can have the greatest positive impact on your life. Eat That Frog! shows you how to organize each day so you can zero in on these critical tasks and accomplish them efficiently and effectively.",eat frog isnt enough time everything todo list never successful people dont try everything learn focus important task make sure get done eat frog there old saying first thing morning eat live frog youll satisfaction knowing youre done worst thing youll day tracy eating frog metaphor tackling challenging task also one greatest positive impact life eat frog show organize day zero critical task accomplish efficiently effectively,3

Describing it as a self-help book, the author goes back to the early struggles of Bachchan, connecting them with our deepest aspirations. What is success, and does happiness precede or follow success? He reflects on such questions by digging deeper into the trials and tribulations of Bachchan’s rise to fame. In his conversational style, the writer cites examples from everyday life and invites the listeners to think with him, as if he were sharing his thoughts and wisdom with a friend. He points out that in Indian cinema, any film that has a star cast will easily land a producer, distributors and dates for theatrical release and even draw in the advance bookings. Similarly, happiness is a superstar, he says. Through the audiobook, he explains how we can take control of our destiny and be the producer, director and star of our own lives. Bachchan’s life provides insight into how one can persevere through hope, despair, challenges and opportunities. What can we learn from his personal journey and from his larger-than-life image on the screen?   ",bol bachchan speak bachchan author rupesh dubey delf life indian cinema superstar amitabh bachchan compelling compilation incident journey cinema dialogue film lesson life inspiring motivating audiobook draw success mantra life work actor describing selfhelp book author go back early struggle bachchan connecting deepest aspiration success happiness precede follow success reflects question digging deeper trial tribulation bachchans rise fame conversational style writer cite example everyday life invite listener think sharing thought wisdom friend point indian cinema film star cast easily land producer distributor date theatrical release even draw advance booking similarly happiness superstar say audiobook explains take control destiny producer director star life bachchans life provides insight one persevere hope despair challenge opportunity learn personal journey largerthanlife image screen,3
