## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get suggestions based on your preferred genre, author, or title.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive experience.
- **Data Visualizations**: Understand trends and insights through engaging plots.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Leverage algorithms from Scikit-learn for accurate recommendations.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The main programming language for development.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the web application.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of data in graphs.
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for predictive data analysis.

## Installation

To set up the Audible Book Recommender System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elchorly00/audible-book-recommender-system-streamlit.git
   cd audible-book-recommender-system-streamlit
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

## How It Works

The Audible Book Recommender System uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to generate recommendations. 

1. **Data Collection**: The system gathers data from various sources, including user ratings, book descriptions, and genres.
  
2. **Data Processing**: Using Pandas and NumPy, the data is cleaned and prepared for analysis.

3. **Model Training**: Scikit-learn is used to train machine learning models that learn user preferences.

4. **Recommendation Generation**: The trained models provide personalized recommendations based on user input.

5. **Visualization**: Matplotlib and Plotly create visual representations of the data and recommendations.

## Visualizations

The application features several visualizations that help users understand their preferences and the recommendation process. Here are some examples:

- **Genre Distribution**: A pie chart showing the distribution of audiobooks across different genres.
  
- **Top Authors**: A bar graph displaying the most recommended authors based on user preferences.

- **User Ratings**: A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between user ratings and audiobook popularity.
